# image-annotator
General instructions until replaced with something proper 

1) You basically only need the `image_annotator.py` file, which you will use to import the relevant functions like
 `import jupyter_annotator as ja` 
You also need the tutorial notebook https://github.com/nadavyayon/image-annotator/blob/main/Tutorials/image_annotation_tutorial.ipynb
2) You need to setup an env that has bokeh (https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh) and jupyter-bokeh (https://pypi.org/project/jupyter-bokeh/) installed. This is the trickiest bit sometimes 
3) When running on farm, you need to set the port (e.g., 5011) you are using to get it plot properly in the correct place
